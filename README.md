A1 Cybersecurity Solutions Ltd - INCS 4810 Culminating Project

This project demonstrates the potential impact of a cyberattack on an Industrial Control System (ICS) network. The team designed and built a virtual test network with intentional vulnerabilities, and then simulated a realistic attack scenario involving a phishing email to gain initial access, lateral movement to the ICS network, and manipulation of an industrial process, causing a simulated level tank to overflow.

Project Overview
Designed a virtual test network consisting of a business network, an ICS network, and a public network with a Kali Linux machine acting as the attacker
Intentionally included vulnerabilities such as weak passwords, lack of secure network segmentation and access control, and unpatched software
Conducted a simulated cyberattack exploiting these vulnerabilities
Implemented security measures following the ISA-62443 standard, including network segmentation, strong passwords, regular software patching, and employee cybersecurity awareness training

Key Findings
The project successfully demonstrated the potential consequences of a targeted cyberattack on an ICS network
Vulnerabilities in the network allowed the attacker to gain unauthorized access and cause significant damage to the simulated industrial process
Implementing robust cybersecurity measures based on the ISA-62443 standard effectively mitigated the risks and enhanced the security of the network

Recommendations
Prioritize ICS cybersecurity initiatives and adopt a proactive approach to cybersecurity
Implement secure network segmentation, robust firewall and access control rules, secure authentication, and change default and weak passwords
Shut down unused ports on all systems
Establish incident response plans and maintain offline backups to ensure timely recovery in the event of a successful attack

Repository Contents
Final project report detailing the project objectives, methodology, findings, and recommendations
Network diagrams and configuration files for the virtual test network
Code for the simulated cyberattack and implemented countermeasures
Presentation slides showcasing the project and its outcomes
